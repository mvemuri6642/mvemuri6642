Hi there! 👋 I'm Sai Manohar Vemuri

🚀 About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology, specializing in HW/SW co-design for ML/DL on edge devices. My research focuses on object detection, semantic segmentation, and multi-modal sensor fusion for autonomous driving and ADAS. I am passionate about optimizing AI models for real-time edge deployment on FPGAs, GPUs, and low-power embedded systems.

Currently, I am an AI Research Intern at SoundSafe.ai, where I work on secure and resilient audio signal processing, deepfake detection, and watermarking technologies.
